            This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooling technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> 
            cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is 
            precisely set to ther target temperatur you want the foode to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking 
            for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next month, we will be serving <strong><em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the 
            chef table, contact us before November 30.
